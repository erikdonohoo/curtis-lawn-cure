      <h2>A Lawn Cure Program based on Local Experience</h2>
      <p>Thirty five years of local research gives our specialists the experience it takes to cure the most
        difficult lawn and yard problems of northern Utah. We can examine your lawn free of charge and
        recommend the correct procedure to cure any lawn problem. We not only treat with chemicals
        but do mechanical aerating if necessary. If your lawn is too far gone we do seeding or sodding and
        all the soil preparation that goes with it. Deep root feeding for trees and shrubs is also part of our
        service.</p>

      <h2>Our Spray Program</h2>
      <p>Our program is based on prevention. For example, our early spring treatment contains a
        pre-emergent weed control to prevent spurge, crabgrass and foxtail weeds. Our early spring deep
        root feeding for your trees and shrubs includes a systematic insect control to keep bugs off your
        ornamentals all season long. Our late spring treatment contains an insecticide to prevent billbugs
        and other larva from spreading into epidemic proportions. Diagnoses of fungus disease is also part
        of our lawn cure program.</p>

      <h2>A Partnership</h2>
      <p>Of course our treatments alone are not cure-alls. Proper watering and mowing are essential to a
        perfect lawn. Accompanying our treatments you will receive a brochure with suggestions to help
        you. If you have other questions we are as near as your phone.</p>
