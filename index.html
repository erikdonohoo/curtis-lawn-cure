      <h2>A Lawn Cure Program based on Local Experience</h2>
      <p><span id="years-research"></span> years of local research gives our specialists the experience it takes to cure the most
        difficult lawn and yard problems of northern Utah. We can examine your lawn free of charge and
        recommend the correct procedure to cure any lawn problem. We not only treat with chemicals
        but do mechanical aerating if necessary. Deep root feeding for trees and shrubs is also part of our
        service.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Our Spray Program</h2>
      <p>Our program is based on prevention. For example, our early spring treatment contains a
        pre-emergent weed control to prevent spurge, crabgrass and foxtail weeds. Our early spring deep
        root feeding for your trees and shrubs includes a systematic insect control to keep bugs off your
        ornamentals all season long. Our late spring treatment contains an insecticide to prevent billbugs
        and other larva from spreading into epidemic proportions. Diagnoses of fungus disease is also part
        of our lawn cure program.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>A Partnership</h2>
      <p>Of course our treatments alone are not cure-alls. Proper watering and mowing are essential to a
        perfect lawn. Accompanying our treatments you will receive a brochure with suggestions to help
        you. If you have other questions we are as near as your phone.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2><img src="images/HOME/OurGuarantee.png"></h2>
      <p>Our first priority is your complete satisfaction. If for any reason you are not happy with our results,
          please give us a call. A more thorough analysis will be made of any persisting problem to determine
          corrections necessary in our lawn cure program, at no additional cost to you.</p>

        Our lawn care company started in Utah County back in 1979 when Provo was hit by an epidemic of Billbugs. Many lawns were completely
        destroyed by the grub of this pest. We became very proficient at eradicating this pest while at the same time developing a liquid
        nitrogen treatment to speed up the recovery of the lawns we serviced. Over the years we improved our fertilizers and pest controls 
        with the latest technologies and application techniques. We pride ourselves with providing our customers with the best preventatives and
        technology available so that we don't have to try to fix problems which could have been prevented. Hence
        our slogan, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". We invite you to become a part of the Curtis
        Lawn Cure family of satisfied customers. We look forward to seeing you soon!

      <h2><span class="embellish">FAQ</span></h2>
    </article>
    <article class="faq-list">
      <ul>
        <li><p>Does aeration have to be done before the pre-emergent is applied?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          No. Dry conditions and scheduling issues have made it necessary to aerate later when lawns
          have been watered in for better results. Recent studies show that aeratig after the
          pre-emergent is applied has no discernible effects on weed control.
        </li></p>
        <li><p>What is the most common mistake lawn customers make that you have to deal with the most?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          Most people mow too short and trim around the edges instead of edging vertically straight up
          and down. This would prevent most of the weed problems we have to deal with. For example in
          the spring when the average temperature is around 70 degrees mow short about 2 inches
          usually the first mowing or two in the early Spring. As the average temperature increases to
          around 80 degrees raise the mower to at least 2 1/2 inches high. As the temperature approaches
          90 degrees the mower should be raised to at least 3 inches in length. During the hottest months
          of Summer especially June July and August when temperatures are in the upper nineties or even
          100 degrees or above the mower should be raised to at least 3 1/2 inches. In the fall the mower
          can be lowered a notch at a time as temperatures fall, back down to 2 inches for the final mowing
          in mid November.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Why are we having so many problems with lawn diseases such as Necrotic Ring Spot and melting
          out (bleached out looking dead grass)?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          Most disease problems can be corrected by using correct cultural practices such as proper
          watering and mowing. The rule of thumb for watering is "heavy but seldom". Mechanical
          aerating with clean equipment can also be effective in prevention of NRS. A balanced fertilizer
          with slow release nitrogen keeps the lawn healthy and more resistant to NRS and other diseases.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>What watering schedule have you found that works best here along the Wasatch Front?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          Watering deep and infrequent is the key to a healthy disease free lawn. The lawn should be
          allowed to dry out as much as possible between waterings. This encourages roots to go deeper
          "chasing" after the water that remains deeper in the soil profile. By thus training the roots of the
          turf to "stretch" deeper they are literally toughened up to take the heat during the hot summer
          months. This training should begin in the Spring by delaying turning on the sprinklers as long as
          possible. When they are turned on water manually for as long as possible even into early June if
          possible. During April and May usually once a week if needed is sufficient. In June as the weather
          dries out completely, watering once every two or three days is sufficient. Avoid watering every
          day and in the evenings to keep the lawn surface dry for as long as possible. A good watering
          schedule that works well especially in sandy soils is a M W F or a 2 2 3 days apart for a weekly
          schedule. This allows a good opportunity or the lawn to dry out during the busy weekend
          keeping the roots "stretching" at least once a week.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>So how much should I water each time for a deep or heavy watering?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          A lawn should be watered to a depth of at least 6 inches to be healthy. This usually takes about
          1/2 inch of water to reach the proper depth. For the average fan type sprinklers this takes about
          30 minutes. If you have gear driven solid stream sprinklers add about 15 more minutes to your
          watering time. To be exact use a straight sided can such as a tuna can to measure how long it
          takes to water 1/2 inch. Place the can about half the distance the sprinkler reaches. To avoid dry
          spots each area should have double coverage, that is, it takes two sprinklers to water any given
          area evenly.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Are there any other ways I can save water during the arid hot days of Summer?</p></li>
        <li><p>
          For the last couple of years we've been using a water saving product
          called Hydretain. This product actually has the properties of holding
          water next to the roots of the turf. By using this product you can
          eliminate one of the watering days of your schedule. If you are on a
          2 2 3 schedule it can be changed to a once every 3 or 4 days for
          the weekly schedule. If you are watering every 3 days you can cut
          back to once every 5 or 6 days. Even if you have secondary
          water and the price is fixed, the lawn is healthier as a result
          and we don't run out of secondary water only to have it
          completely turned off with lawns burning up. The nice thing about
          Hydretain is it lasts for 90 days. If it is applied in the late Spring it
          works all through the driest part of Summer saving you the most
          water and money.
